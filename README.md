# A Realistic, Business-Focused Retail Analytics Project
# 📁 Project Overview

This project simulates and analyzes a real-world retail business using Python + Power BI. It demonstrates a complete analytics workflow, including:

Synthetic dataset creation (100,000+ records)

Sales & revenue analysis

Inventory performance tracking

Customer behavior insights

Delivery & operations analytics

Category-wise sales forecasting (Prophet)

Interactive Power BI dashboards

Actionable business recommendations

# 🧠 Key Objectives

✔ Build a realistic end-to-end retail dataset
✔ Perform thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✔ Identify daily, weekly & monthly sales trends
✔ Understand customer value & spending patterns
✔ Detect delivery delays & operational bottlenecks
✔ Evaluate stock health & potential stock-out risks
✔ Forecast future category-wise demand
✔ Present insights visually using Power BI

# 🗂 Datasets Created

The Python script generates 4 fully synthetic but realistic datasets:

Dataset	Description	Rows
sales_clean.csv	Daily transactions, stores, pricing, units sold	~30k–40k
customers_clean.csv	Customer type, region, spend, orders	~20k
inventory_clean.csv	Stock levels, reorder points, supplier data	~300
operations_clean.csv	Delivery durations, order dates, delays	~30k–40k

These datasets feed directly into the Power BI dashboard.
